# Testing Trello Project
This project is for showing different kinds of tests with different tools. I'd like to introduce testing API and UI. 
I'd like to use different tools like selenium, playwright to show differences between them. The main topic of 
this project is automating tests. 

In main directory there is several another directories with name show what kind of tests this folder contains. 
Because there will be different language and tools You can treat every main directory as different project contains own
pyproject.toml file to build proper environment.
